I'm currently pursuing a PhD in the Department of Mathematics at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, supervised by [St√©phanie van der Pas](https://www.stephanievanderpas.nl/) and [Wessel van Wieringen](https://www.math.vu.nl/~wvanwie/). My research is part of the BayCause project, funded by the European Research Council (ERC).

I develop statistical methodology for causal inference, with a focus on survival data and high-dimensional settings. Both pose unique challenges to reliable causal effect estimation. I aim to make my methods accessible through open-source software.


**Research interests:**
- Causal inference  
- Bayesian non-parametric methods  
- Tree ensembles  
- Survival analysis  
- High-dimensional data
