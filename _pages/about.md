I'm currently pursuing a PhD in the Department of Mathematics at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, under the supervision of [Stephanie van der Pas](https://www.stephanievanderpas.nl/) and [Wessel van Wieringen](https://www.math.vu.nl/~wvanwie/). My work is part of the BayCause project, funded by the European Research Council (ERC).

My work focuses on developing statistical methodology for causal inference. I am particularly interested in survival data and high-dimensional setting. Both present unique challenges to reliable causal inference. I aim to make these methods available through open-source software.

**Research interests:**
- Causal inference  
- Bayesian non-parametric methods  
- Tree ensembles  
- Survival analysis  
- High-dimensional data
